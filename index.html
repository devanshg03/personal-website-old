                <a>The VC Memo</a>
                <p> <strong>Role:</strong> Founder <br> <strong>Started:</strong> June 2022 <br> <strong>Status:</strong> Stopped<br> <strong>About:</strong> This was a project I worked briefly on to start a venture capital focused newsletter for University students interested in the startup and venture capital industry. This was intended to be a weekly newsletter that would cover the overview of the public markets, recap the 5 biggest venture capital deals closed that week and then take a deep-dive into an interesting startup.</p>

                    <strong>About:</strong> This was an idea I had to make a tinder-style app that would match aspiring entrepreneurs with a startup idea that someone else needed help on. I coded this project and made a very simple app to show to others and validate my idea. In the end, I realized matching people just based on the idea would not work as there is so much more to building a team.</p>

                    <strong>About:</strong> This is a my first startup, an e-commerce store that allows people to have customized phone cases. I designed and sources phone cases on demand for customers, and achieved a revenue of 4 digits in 6 months. Ultimately I realized this was not something I would like to pursue as it did not have a technological or much of a competitive advantage over other phone cases.</p>

                    <strong>About:</strong> When I was eleven, I was quite fascinated with the idea of having a YouTube channel and posting videos. Despite being in China, I decided to borrow a camera from my parents are start shooting videos about my scale model cars. Being in China allowed my to get access to scale models not usually available overseas. Eventually, I transitioned to posting more diverse content, including vlogs and then gaming videos. At the peak of my channel, I had over 1,000 subscribers and an active community.</p>
