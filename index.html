                        This was a project I worked briefly on to start a venture capital focused newsletter for University students interested in the startup and venture capital industry. This was intended to be a weekly newsletter that would cover the overview of the public markets, recap the 5 biggest venture capital deals closed that week and then take a deep-dive into an interesting startup.

                        This was an idea I had to make a tinder-style app that would match aspiring entrepreneurs with a startup idea that someone else needed help on. I coded this project and made a very simple app to show to others and validate my idea. In the end, I realized matching people just based on the idea would not work as there is so much more to building a team.

                        This is a my first startup, an e-commerce store that allows people to have customized phone cases. I designed and sources phone cases on demand for customers, and achieved a revenue of 4 digits in 6 months. Ultimately I realized this was not something I would like to pursue as it did not have a technological or much of a competitive advantage over other phone cases.

                        I started an Instagram page to connect with owners of Nissan X-Trail and share people's unique cars from all over the world, with different modifications and acessories. Eventually, I stopped posting on this page due to a lack of time, but it has still gained over 1,100 followers. This was just a project I started to get involved in the car enthusiast community.

                        When I was eleven, I was quite fascinated with the idea of having a YouTube channel and posting videos. Despite being in China, I decided to start shooting videos about my scale model cars. Eventually, I transitioned to posting more diverse content, including vlogs and then gaming videos. At the peak of my channel, I had over 1,000 subscribers and an active community.
